# REDROB AI - Intelligent Candidate Ranking System

An end-to-end AI-powered candidate retrieval and ranking system built for the **REDROB Hackathon**.

The system transforms an unstructured job description into a ranked list of the top 100 candidates using LLMs, hybrid retrieval, feature engineering, weighted ranking, and explainable AI.

# Retrieval Pipeline

Hybrid retrieval combines:

- Dense Semantic Search
- BM25 Keyword Search
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion

to maximize recall before ranking.

---

# Ranking Features

The ranking model considers multiple signals including:

- Semantic Similarity
- BM25 Score
- RRF Score
- Skill Overlap
- Preferred Skill Match
- Experience Gap
- Current Title Similarity
- Industry Match
- Location Match
- Recruiter Response Rate
- GitHub Activity Score
- Profile Completeness

---

# Explainability

Each ranked candidate is accompanied by a human-readable explanation describing why they were ranked highly.

Example:

> Ranked highly due to strong semantic similarity with the job requirements, high skill overlap, relevant experience, and excellent recruiter engagement signals.

---

# Output

The pipeline generates:

```
outputs/final_submission.csv
```

Example columns:

| Column | Description |
|----------|------------|
| candidate_id | Candidate ID |
| rank | Final Rank |
| score | Ranking Score |
| reasoning | Explanation for Ranking |

---

# Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Tackle_redrob_hackthon.git
```

Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# Run

Execute the complete pipeline:

```bash
python tests/test_pipeline.py
```

The ranked candidate list will be generated inside:

```
outputs/final_submission.csv
```
